Color Plus Game
INTRUCTIONS:
Color Plus is a cooperative two-player game. Player 1 uses the keyboard and Player 2 uses the mouse.

Player 1: Use the numbers 1-4 to move the Next Cube into one of the rows on the grid.
Player 2: Click the cubes on the grid and drag them around to create a +. Try the same color or one of every color!

BE CAREFUL! Black cubes will spawn if you don't put a cube in the grid in time and you will lose points. If black cubes fill up one row, you automatically lose. 
You have 1 minute to score as many points as possible!
